                >Michael Joseph Jackson</a
              >
              (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American singer,
              songwriter, dancer, and philanthropist. Dubbed the "King of Pop",
              he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of
              the 20th century. Over a four-decade career, his contributions to
              music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized personal
              life, made him a global figure in popular culture. Jackson
              influenced artists across many music genres; through stage and
              video performances, he popularized complicated dance moves such as
              the moonwalk, to which he gave the name, as well as the robot. He
              is the most awarded individual music artist in history.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Jackson (aged 11 years, 155 days or 11 years, 5 months, and 2
              days) is the youngest vocalist ever to top the Hot 100. As part of
              the Jackson 5, he topped the charts with "I Want You Back" on the
              week of January 31, 1970.
            </li>
            <li>
              Jackson's Thriller (1982) remained at the top on the Billboard 200
              album chart for thirty-seven weeks, setting a record for the
              longest run at number one by a studio album. It is only one of two
              albums to have sold more copies in the United States than any
              other in two separate years, topping the sales charts in 1983 and
              1984.
            </li>
            <li>
              Thriller is currently the second best-selling album of all time in
              the United States and the second most certified album after the
              Eagles' Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975), with total units of 34
              million sold to date.
            </li>
            <li>
              Jackson's Bad (1987) remained at top 5 on the Billboard 200 album
              chart for thirty-eight weeks, setting a record for the longest run
              at top five by an album from a male solo artist.
            </li>
            <li>
              In July 2009, three of Jackson's albums (Number Ones, The
              Essential Michael Jackson and Thriller) claimed the top three
              positions on Billboard's Top Pop Catalog Albums and Top
              Comprehensive Albums charts in the week following the singer's
              death. marking the first time any catalog album outsold the number
              one album on the Billboard 200. Additionally, eight of the top
              nine positions on Top Pop Catalog Albums were owned by Jackson,
              with a ninth held by a Jackson 5 hits collection. This made
              Jackson the only solo artist to achieve such feat.
            </li>
            <li>
              Jackson was the first artist to launch seven top ten singles off
              one album.
            </li>
            <li>
              Jackson's Bad is only one of two albums where five singles off one
              album topped the Billboard Hot 100.
            </li>
            <li>
              Jackson became the first recording artist to land number one
              singles in three decades after "Black or White" topped the
              Billboard Hot 100 in December 1991. His first number-one single,
              "Ben", topped the Billboard Hot 100 in October 1972.
            </li>
            <li>
              Jackson became the first artist to simultaneously top Billboard's
              album chart and the number one single on both the pop and R&B
              charts, with Thriller and "Billie Jean" in the week of March 5,
              1983.
            </li>
            <li>
              Jackson had more number-one singles than any other recording
              artist in the 1980s with ten singles.
            </li>
            <li>

              Jackson has had 13 number-one singles on Billboard's Hot 100,
              making him the male artist with most No. 1 Hits in the Hot 100
              era.Including Pre- Hot 100, Jackson follows Elvis Presley for the
              most number ones by a male artist and ranks fifth overall.
            </li>
            <li>

              Drake, Madonna, the Beatles, and Rihanna having more.
            </li>
            <li>
              Jackson currently holds a record for the longest span of top forty
              singles on the Billboard Hot 100 in a span of 46 years and eight
              months, with his debuting solo single, "Got to Be There", entering
              the chart on November 6, 1971, and his posthumous duet with Drake,
              "Don't Matter to Me", first charting on July 14, 2018.
            </li>
            <li>
              Jackson is the only act to have top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot
              100 across five consecutive decades (1970s–2010s) and six
              consecutive decades including his work with the Jackson 5
              (1960s–2010s) when "I Want You Back" charted at No. 8 on the week
              of December 27, 1969, in the Billboard Hot 100.
